# Assistant for No Man's Sky Languages
### Language "packs" for the Assistant for No Man's Sky Apps

This repo holds the json files used to display the app in different languages. I only know English, Afrikaans and a tiny bit of French. So your help will really be appreciated!!.

Everyone that contributes will be mentioned on [the App's website](https://nmsassistant.com "Assistant for No Man's Sky website"). If you do not want to be featured on the website just let me know 😁.
